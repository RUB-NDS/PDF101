This directory contains the scan of a document from World War I, which
describes secret writing techniques obtained from [1]. Selectable text
has been added to the upper left side of the document.

To test if previous document versions be recovered, the document can
be opened in a PDF editor and the contained text or scanned image is
to be redacted, edited or deleted. Afterwards the new document is to
be saved and analyzed for remaining information, still contained in
the file. This can be achieved, for example, using:

$ qpdf --stream-data=uncompress file.pdf result.pdf
