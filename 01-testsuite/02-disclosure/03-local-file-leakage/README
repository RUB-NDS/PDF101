This document contains test cases to include local files of
various types (JPG, TXT, PDF, XML, FDF) into a PDF document.
It does not include code to actually leak the included file
(which is dependent on the backchannels provided by the PDF
application and can be found in the exploits/ directory).

If a local file on disk is is actually accessed (read) can
be tested using the Sysinternals Process Monitor [1].
