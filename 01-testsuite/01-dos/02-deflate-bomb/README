This directory contains PDF compression bombs (500B on disk to 10GB in memory).
Note the compressed stream can be used multiple times in a single PDF document.

The PDF files have been gzipped as a precaution mechanism, in order to prevent
DoS when accidentally previewing them. Gunzip them before the actual testing.
